# test-Oh life

Is just a game.
No one ever tells you how to play.
See different people.
Go different ways.
Some of them will leave you but.
Some of them will stay.
Well our hearts keep drumming.
And the years keep coming.
Quicker than they’ve ever been.
You’re sick of the same thing.
But it’s quicker than changing.
It's too late to begin.
Well everybody’s running.
But you don’t know where.
Time is running thin.
Everybody’s looking for somebody to love.
But we’re scared to let them in.
And I say oh oh oh.
Are there any survivors?
Am I here alone?
I say oh oh oh.
Are there any survivors?.
Am I here alone?
Am I on my own?
Am I on my own?
Oh love.
It comes and goes.
But no one never tells you how to learn to let go.
Different people, they walk different roads.
Some of them will hurt you but.
Some of them won’t.
Well the bridge is burning.
And the wheel keeps turning.
Quicker than it did before.
Your heart screams "yes".
Your head says "no".
And you’re never really sure.
Well everybody’s running.
But you don’t know why.
Time is running short.
Everybody’s looking for a place to hide.
So there’s no one left at all.
And I say oh oh oh.
Are there any survivors?
Am I here alone?
Yeah I say oh oh oh.
Are there any survivors?
Am I here alone?
Am I here alone?
Oh oh oh.
Am I here alone?
Oh oh, oh oh.
Yeah.
Yeah I say oh oh oh.
Are there any survivors?
Am I here alone?
And I say oh oh oh.
Are there any survivors?
Am I here alone?
I say oh oh oh.
Are there any survivors?
Am I here alone?
Oh oh oh oh oh.
Are there any survivors?
Am I here alone?just a test, oh life, it's just a game, no one really tells you how to play.
